LDAP interface to search and bind (authenticate) against Unix passwd files.

This is very rough implementation, designed to work with the Subsonic media 
player. 


To Do:
  - Use hashed admin password
  - Implement add/modify/delete (without service running as root)
  - Bind to privileged ports (e.g. 389) without service running as root
